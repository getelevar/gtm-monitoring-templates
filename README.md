# Elevar GTM Monitoring Templates

> Monitoring templates used in GTM to report errors happening in variables/tags

## ðŸš€ Quick start

```
# install dependencies
yarn
```

Then you can execute the code with either `node ./index.js` or running Quokka in the `index.js` file.

## Warning

The local modules aren't the same ones that are run in GTM but they have been built to resemble them. Output might vary and everything should be tested in GTM.
